            <p>Computer systems are everywhere today. From business to entertainment, from shopping to education, in our daily lives, communication and in every situation, it is difficult to imagine a world without computers.
                Communication
                Computer systems are more often than not linked together in networks and the ability to connect with these networks is something we take for granted now. We can now communicate across the planet at a speed that was unimaginable only a few years ago. Using our smartphones, tablets, laptops and personal computers, we can send and receive data from wherever we are. 
                Business
                Businesses make extensive use of computers. Jobs that used to take specialists a long time to do can now be done by a lot of people. For example, many people know how to set up and use spreadsheets for looking after accounts. Word processors are used by many people to write letters. Databases are used to search through millions of records and reorganise them very quickly. Images, video and sound can be manipulated easily now using a variety of packages. All of these types of jobs were done by specialists in the past. Now they are accessible to everyone, perhaps with some degree of training. Computers are used in factories to control operations, to build things using robots and to monitor processes in ways that are far better than humans ever could. Anyone can set-up a business easily online using the Internet now and appear to be a very large company and you can run an online business completely from home, too.
                Employment
                There have been many changes to employment patterns. Increasingly, people work from home (called 'tele-working'). They can organise their working life around their home life, which might be important if someone has children or a disability. A range of computer equipment now allows someone to do their job and stay in contact with their employers. Workers can be based anywhere in the world. There are many jobs that didn't exist a few years ago and in the future, there will be many types of jobs that we can't predict today. This is why it is very important for students to learn to be adaptable and to be able to change skills easily.
